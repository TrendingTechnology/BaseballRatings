## Overview

This project uses historical baseball games data to calculate an Elo-like rating for MLB teams based on regular season match ups. The Elo rating system was originally developed for ranking chess players but also can

A similar analysis was done by 538:

This report consists of three primary pieces of code:
* `Parser.py` imports and cleans the game-level data. It performs basic calculations, such as determining game winners.
* `Elo.py` calculates Elo ratings for a given set of games data
* `Visualization.R` plots the output in a variety of interesting ways


## Data

The formats of the data can be found in the `Formats.py` module.
 
## Examples

This graph shows the distribution of each team's Elo rating over the course of the decade 2010-2019. The ratings are weighted by in-season days.

## Future improvements 

* Finish tuning parameters for best model performance
* Expand analysis to earlier time periods (requires handling of teams entering/leaving league)
